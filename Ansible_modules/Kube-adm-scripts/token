Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 172.31.4.98:6443 --token 9v35ro.9tk5oi59qozd3np2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:4b4c2d0045efabd30c77d30da148824472bb96a86d40eb8a7b67c9a0e68b2160 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key d03d6cbde7142e78e2bb854295f27c90539a8b727b7710098437e8598ec81f92

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.31.4.98:6443 --token 9v35ro.9tk5oi59qozd3np2 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:4b4c2d0045efabd30c77d30da148824472bb96a86d40eb8a7b67c9a0e68b2160
